## 2026-02-06 - Loop Fusion and Memoization for Metrics
**Learning:** Fusing multiple array iterations (filter, map, reduce) into a single pass and wrapping them in `useMemo` significantly reduces computational overhead, especially when processing complex data like application timelines for insights.
**Action:** Always look for multiple passes over the same data array and combine them into a single loop when calculating derived metrics.
